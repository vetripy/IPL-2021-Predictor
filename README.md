# IPL-2021-Predictor
Predicting IPL Scores 

This program predicts the total score of a team with the previous data, before 6 overs.

Contains historic data of T20 matches that have occurred in the past. This dataset may be used by the candidate teams to train an ML model or come up with a data analytics based algorithm that can perform the required prediction as mentioned above

SubmissionFormat.zip contains two python source files main.py and predictor.py.
(The lower the points, better is the prediction outcome).
predictor.py: In the sample format, predictor.py contains a definition predictRuns().
main.py: This is a test file. It is recommended to NOT edit this file. Once you implement the predictor.py, you can test the functionality of your implementation.
